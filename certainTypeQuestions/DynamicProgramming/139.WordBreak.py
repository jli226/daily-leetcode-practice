# Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

# Note:

# The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
# You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".


def word_break(s, words):
    d = [False] * len(s)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for w in words:
            if w == s[i-len(w)+1:i+1] and (d[i-len(w)] or i-len(w) == -1):
                d[i] = True
    return d[-1]
