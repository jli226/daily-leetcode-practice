# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

# Example 1:

# Input: [2,3,-2,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.


def maxProduct(self, A):
        B = A[::-1]
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            A[i] *= A[i - 1] or 1
            B[i] *= B[i - 1] or 1
        return max(A + B)
