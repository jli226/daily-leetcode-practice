# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

# How many possible unique paths are there?


# Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?


# Example 1:

# Input: m = 3, n = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
# 1. Right -> Right -> Down
# 2. Right -> Down -> Right
# 3. Down -> Right -> Right

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
