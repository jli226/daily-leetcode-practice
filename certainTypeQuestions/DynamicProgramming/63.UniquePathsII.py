# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

# Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?


# An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

# Note: m and n will be at most 100.

# Example 1:

# Input:
# [
#   [0,0,0],
#   [0,1,0],
#   [0,0,0]
# ]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
# There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
# 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
# 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
