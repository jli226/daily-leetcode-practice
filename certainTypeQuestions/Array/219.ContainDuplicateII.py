# Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
# Output: true


def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums, k):
    dic = {}
    for i, v in enumerate(nums):
        if v in dic and i - dic[v] <= k:
            return True
        dic[v] = i
    return False
