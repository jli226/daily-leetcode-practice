# Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

# Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

# Example:

# Input:
# [
#   [1,3,1],
#   [1,5,1],
#   [4,2,1]
# ]
# Output: 7

    for i in range(1, m):
