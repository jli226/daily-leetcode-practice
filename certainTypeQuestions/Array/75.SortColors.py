# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

# Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

# Example:

# Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
# Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]


def sortColors(self, nums):
    red, white, blue = 0, 0, len(nums)-1

    while white <= blue:
        if nums[white] == 0:
            nums[red], nums[white] = nums[white], nums[red]
            white += 1
            red += 1
        elif nums[white] == 1:
            white += 1
        else:
            nums[white], nums[blue] = nums[blue], nums[white]
